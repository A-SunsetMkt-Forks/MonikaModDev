# Diary entries FOR MONIKA
#

# FUCK TAXABLE INCOME

# Diary entries whitepaper:
# 
# Diary entries are effectively little snippets into the everyday life of
# monika from her point of view. WE use a combination of metric data gathering
# and templating to somewhat achieve relasitic diary entries.
#
# Also, we checksum the diary for changes and also use access time to check if
# the user has played around with the diary, Monika will get mad if you touch
# it without her asking, ya know.
#
# Diaries should be written once per day, with multiple diary entries being 
# written if the player stopped visiting her. We'll cap this at like 3-5 days
# so we dont get too many bland entries.
#
# we'll use a persistet to keep track if a diary entry has been made today.
# i thjink that should be good for this.
#
# diary templates are scanned via the startswith keyword and extension

# TODO:
# diary templates are nearly fully customizable. Using a {keyword} system, you
# can construct templates of varying setups and stuff. Couple of key things:
# - [player] variables work as well, they are treated using renpy.substitute.
# - date keywords are designed to work for current date. 
# - the CSV keywords generate comma separated lists of stuff.
# - the section keywords are used to pick out lines/section of text that are
#   related to one thing.

# SECTIONS:
# so sections are like text groups that are related to stuff
# They have properties associated with them that are important for classifying
# a section's availability, since sometimes we can't use templated sections
# if some criteria isn't available.
#
# Sections use: @keyword|modifier@
#
# lets say this is an example:
# NOTE: these are actually stored in a text file so we avoid storing execess
# strings in memory
#
# GAMES:
# @<game name>|<wlpn>@ (win, lost, played, not played)
#   if game isnt there, assume not played
